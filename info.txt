All Possible States by 36, released 10 December 2021

1. All Possible States
2. All Possible States (Reprise)

'All Possible States' was originally released as part of a very limited Anonymous 12" on PITP in 2020, featuring 36 and Isaac Helsen. The idea was to let people hear the music and judge it not on the names behind it, but purely on the quality of the music itself. When it sold out, we revealed who wrote it. Obviously quite a few 36 fans missed out, so PITP have repressed the record, but this time with the knowledge of who made the tunes now public. Everyone deserves a second chance!

'All Possible States' was written in 2018, during the same sessions as 'Ego Death'. Indeed, it uses the same synth and minimal, ultra-melancholic style and has quickly become a firm favourite by fans of my music. Isaac's beautiful tune is not included in the digital version here, but can be bought separately from the PITP Bandcamp page https://pitp.bandcamp.com/album/anon-1

For this 3six Recordings digital re-release, I have gathered some friends from the PITP label and we've all worked together on a special 'Reprise' version, which transforms the original tune and takes it to beautiful new places. Spread over 20 minutes, it extends and blurs the original, with each artist taking turns to add their own unique flair to the mix. The end result is an incredibly emotional journey in sound.

Note that this is a digital-only track, not on the vinyl. Thank you to Zach, KÃ©vin and Cynthia for their generosity and immense talent. Please follow them on their Bandcamp pages below:
